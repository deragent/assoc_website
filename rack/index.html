title: Octanis Racks
teaser: 'Let this be an attempt at changing the way we work and how we share tools. A rack is a mobile square meter footprint wardrobe on wheels with a smart dashboard managing everything.  Make anything you want with easy to use tools for prototyping and testing. Will you make the leap to create something today?'

		<p>
			Our goal is to make prototyping tools less intimidating and more accessible to everyone.
			Octanis Racks are the ideal platform for tools and prototyping devices, allowing fully automated access control to tools.
			One rack contains up to eight computer controlled (RFID) and lockable compartments.
			Foldout tables offer a convenient work surface.

		<p>You have access to one, you have access to all. Access to tools in the rack is managed by an onboard computer connected to the Octanis rack management system.
		For tools not requiring prior instruction, booking is simple: Select the tool and specify how long you'll use it for. That's it!
