Dozens of candidates have responded to our call for applications and we shortlisted 10 candidates. These candidates were tasked with a 48h <a href="/media/challenge.pdf">challenge</a> to design their own experiment to be executed in Antarctica. Although 48 hours
is not a lot of time, candidates managed to create phenomenal work.

We are currently reviewing the work and will have more to annouce very soon.
