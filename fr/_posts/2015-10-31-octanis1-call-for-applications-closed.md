The official deadline for the call for applications for the role of "Field Scientist" is closing today. We have received many applications from all over the world and would like to thank all applicants.

A jury will select 10 applicants based on their skills and experience. The selected applicants will be required to complete a task within 48 hours. This task consists of defining a research question for themselves. 

All applicants will receive a message tonight (CET) with further details.

Stay tuned.
