title: Learning means solving problems
teaser: Do you feel stuck, thinking that realising an idea requires you to already have skills, experience and funds? <br/>At Octanis, we provide an environment where we turn theory into practice and learning means doing. We share experiences and tools, and make rapid incremental progress while embracing failure.  Above all, we accept everyone for who they are.
