<p>If you remember well, we were using PU foam in the insulation box that will keep the electronics of Octanis working at 100%</p>
<p>Well, now we're trying a new material that is easier than the foam to shape, we are currently running a long test in both (the PU foam and the rock wool).</p>

<p>We covered the interior of the a cardboard box with a 4cm layer of rock wool, and with out any heating source we were able to kept the inner temperature in an environment of&nbsp; -77&deg;C during 24 hours.</p>

 <p>This result is incredibly promising, and inspire us to run a test during a longer period of time.</p>
