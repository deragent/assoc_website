<p>Octanis' body will be relatively large (30x30x15cm) but it's "brains" - the main computer and electronics - will be very small in comparison. This leaves a lot of empty space for insulating the electronics as much as possible. Having little energy to spare, heating is not something we can afford to do all the time.</p>
<p>The task was to find the best possible insulation for the project that is also easy to find and cheap to buy. The choice: PU foam, also known as expanding foam that comes in cans. PUs thermals conductivity is one of the lowest coming in just after aerogel with 0.02 W/mK.</p>
<p>We have conducted a heater test to see how much time our 5W heater requires to heat the internal box which insulated by the PU foam. A picture of our foam monster below.<br />

<p>The resulting temperature curve is delighting. Three hours or 15Wh are required to raise the temperature by 20&deg;C and in over 15 hours the internals have only lost around 5&deg;C.<br />
